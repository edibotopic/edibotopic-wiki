An overview of typical documentation challenges.

## Setting up a documentation platform

An organisation does not have an effective way of hosting their documentation.

## Creating an internal knowledge base

A team must quickly create and share information with each other.

## Restructuring product documentation

The sections and sub-sections in a documentation set are poorly organised.

## Implementing quality standards

Contributions to documentation are not of reliable or consistent quality.

## Writing user-facing guides

Content needs to be created for specific user personas.

# Role of documentation experts

## Documentation as revealing

There is an idea that one of the functions of documentation is to better reveal
the thing being documented. In the process, the nature what is being documented
can be revealed more clearly, benefiting its documentation but also its further
design.
