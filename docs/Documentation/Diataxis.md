An approach to technical documentation based on four principal documentation
types:

* [[Howto|How-to]]
* [[Tutorial]]
* [[Reference]]
* [[Explanation]]

Diataxis was developed by Daniela Procida. The model divides documentation into
four types:

* How-to guides
* Tutorials
* Explanations
* References

These are further grouped in two ways:

* Whether a skill is being acquired or applied
* Whether the user is doing or thinking

For example:

* Tutorials help people learn new skills through doing
* References provide information to help people apply their skills
