A wiki is a digital publication format.
The word _wiki_ comes from a Hawaiian word for “quick”.

## Characteristics

Wikis are characterised by:

* Collaborative editing
* Minimal structure
* Distributed ownership
* Encyclopedic scope

The inventor of the wiki cited the following characteristics:

> A wiki invites all users — not just experts — to edit any page or to create new pages within the wiki website (...)
>
> Wiki promotes meaningful topic associations between different pages by making page link creation intuitively easy and showing whether an intended target page exists or not.
>
> A wiki is *not* a carefully crafted site created by experts and professional writers and designed for casual visitors. Instead, it seeks to involve the typical visitor/user in an ongoing process of creation and collaboration that constantly changes the website landscape.

## As documentation

Compared to conventional documentation, wikis can be more changeable, niche and unstructured.
This can be uncomfortable for expert maintainers, who design documentation systems for quality, completeness and maintainability.

Modern, non-wiki documentation often permits user contributions. For example, an `edit this page on GitHub` button. However, this should not be mistaken for the level of user control a wiki offers. In a wiki, a user can not only edit an existing page but also generate a new one. By defining paths and tags, a user can also participate in developing the wikis structure. This level of input in other documentation would likely require careful planning, pull requests and multiple rounds of review.

A sufficiently large community can be trusted to both generate content and maintain its quality. Popular wikis, however, do have dedicated editors. Wikipedia is a notable example. There can therefore be a productive interplay between experts and beginners, owners and users.

## Growth and aspiration

All digital content is subject to change, to an extent. Wikis, however, fully embrace this dynamic.

On the web, a broken link is usually a bad thing. It is a pointer to nothing.

Many website generators and content management systems will flag broken links.

Now consider this description of [[aspiring pages]] by the developer of [[silver bullet]], a personal wiki:

> An aspiring page is a page that does not yet exist, but is already linked to.

A user who creates a “broken link” has therefore pointed to a potential page.
Indeed, generation such “aspiring pages” on-the-fly is a natural part of writing a wiki.

## Hidden structure

Wikis are not without structure.

They are characterized by strong inter-connection. Many personal wikis now offer a graph-based visualisation, which reflect their graph structure.

They usually include some degree of nesting. In this way, they have the characteristic of a tree.

They often support tags. This allows the construction of complex category systems.

A wiki can be a flat list of files, then it's structure can be developed with links, nesting and tags.

> **note** Example
> A page on Audio exists at /Audio
> A page on ALSA at /Audio/ALSA
> Pages at /Audio/ALSA/* are tagged with [[diataxis]] categories like how-to and reference.

## Rabbit holes

A wiki encourages a unique kind of information traversal.

You start in one place that you intended to visit, then through a series of links you end up in several unexpected places.

Wikis promote curiosity-driven learning.

An organisation can have multiple individual documentation sites.
These can be inter-linked and each can contain their own internal links.
Excessive linking in these sites is often discouraged.
It can be distracting and disorienting to users.
