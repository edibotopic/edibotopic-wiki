title: Holistic Turn
---

A epistemological process in which knowledge is reoriented towards the
the *whole* of a system after a prolonged focus on the *parts* of a system.

This can manifest in transitions such as:

- Material → Form
- Analysis → Synthesis
- Composition → Structure
- Data → Model
- Causality → Appearances
- Mechanism → Intuition
- Scholarship → Design

Holism is usually conceived in opposition to reductionism.
However, holism can itself become reductionistic.

A holism that urges us to focus on intuition and appearances,
over mechanism and causality, is merely a reduction to the
superficial.
It is important to not consider reductionism in strict
*spatial* terms by — for example — thinking of it as
always concerning a move from big to small.
More broadly, it is a *narrowing* of focus on some
set of concerns at the expense of others.

[[Systemism]] is the unification of 
reductionism and holism, which is often characteristic
of effective investigations.
