_Epistemological obstacle_ was the term used by Gaston Bachelard in [The
Formation of the Scientific
Mind](https://www.topoi.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/The-Formation-of-the-Scientific-Mind.pdf)
to describe false ideas that impede our progress in learning about the world.
He was specifically referring to ideas — most often metaphors — that persisted
in science for extended periods through history.

The famous computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra highlighted the (dead)
metaphor of the programming "bug" in his [On the cruelty of really teaching
computing
science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html#:~:text=The%20animistic%20metaphor%20of%20the,is%20the%20programmer's%20own%20creation):

While the bug metaphor seems harmless, Dijkstra argues that it shapes the
practitioner's worldview in a pathological way. Bugs are entities that
spontaneously appear and when they do we must initiate a process of debugging.
The introduction of errors becomes naturalised and accepted, a fundamental part
of one's workflow. It is an epistemological obstacle.

The bug metaphor is a generator of difficult [[Inverse problems|inverse
problems]]. It allows for the multiplication of _effects_ with unknown
_causes_. To solve the problem we have to begin each time the difficult process
of approaching the unknown. A great deal of a programmer's time is devoted to
finding and eliminating bugs of unknown origin.
