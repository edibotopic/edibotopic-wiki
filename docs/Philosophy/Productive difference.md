title: Productive Difference
---

Reality can be understood as being shaped by productive differences between
certain physical quantities:

- Heat travels from high-temperature to low-temperature
- Low density oil floats in higher density water
- A pressure drop along a pipe results in flow

Each of these quantities — temperature, density, pressure — are _intensive_,
meaning that their magnitude is independent of their size.

The concept of such _gradients of intensity_ was used by the philosopher Manuel
DeLanda in his [Intensive Science and Virtual
Philosophy](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/intensive-science-and-virtual-philosophy-9781780935935/),
a book in the philosophy of science influenced by the ontological thought of
Deleuze and Spinoza.
