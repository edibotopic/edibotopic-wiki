# Ambiguity

Ambiguity arises when a statement, object or event does not
suggest a clear and obvious interpretation.

When operating machinery or performing surgery, ambiguity of
instruction can be fatal.

In certain domains — most notably mathematics, logic and programming —
ambiguities are ruthlessly identified and removed.

Surgeons and logicians are understandably wary of ambiguity,
yet, in everyday communication, there is some tolerance of ambiguity.

There are different causes of ambiguity, including:

* Limited understanding of a topic
* Poor mastery of the language
* Undisciplined speech

In such cases, ambiguity emerges **involuntarily**.

Over time, someone may transition to a different level of understanding,
mastery or tiredness, resulting in greater or lesser levels of ambiguity.

While this demands sensitivity from us socially, it is perhaps the less
interesting case as far as ambiguity is concerned.

Sometimes ambiguity is **deliberate**, consider:

* Ambiguity as a strategy in conflict management
* Ambiguity as a device in the arts
* Ambiguity as an affordance in recipes
* Ambiguity in romantic flirtation
* Ambiguity as a defence against persecution
* Ambiguity in shaping our personal identity

Here, the expansion of possible interpretations afforded by ambiguity can have benefits.

Even in a methodical discipline like science, ambiguity can be understood
as an essential stage of that activity.
Ambiguity is a "problem" in the sense of a _puzzle_.

Any scientific discovery begins with an ambiguity:
a [phenomenon that admits of multiple possible interpretations](@/notes/inverseproblems.md).
This prompts the scientist to seek the most likely interpretation.

A great scientist seeks out ambiguity with the same vigour because
it generates scientific questions.

It is unreasonable to expect there to be no ambiguity in daily life.
While there are specific cases where ambiguity is not optimal or safe,
a completely unambiguous reality would be a very dull place.

We can't expect a poem to be a proof, a war to be a flatpack, a person to be a lever.
