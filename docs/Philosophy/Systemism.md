title: Systemism
---

Systemism is an epistemology that attempts to
achieve a fusion between holism and reductionism.

This encompasses two kinds of *reduction*:

- Macro-reduction: from parts to wholes
- Micro-reduction: from wholes to parts

Having observed some interesting phenomenon in the world
there is an attempt to identify the mechanism that caused it.
This is a micro-reduction.
Equipped with this new understanding a model of the phenomenon
can be constructed.
This is a macro-reduction.

Crucially, the initial naive observation — a human experience — is
not destroyed or undermined in this process.
It may remain sufficient for many people, and may be enriched for
those who have obtained the new knowledge.

## The Basic Model

A basic model of systemism, outlined by
[Mario Bunge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Bunge)
as an alternative to reductionism and holism,
will here be outlined in brief.

Imagine you have made a _causal_ observation of some kind.
This could be that:

- A particular seasoning makes the dinner tastier
- A function in some code makes the program crash
- A joke makes the people around you uncomfortable

These cause-effect relations are salient and apparent
in your _immediate context_.

This is the `macro` level.
It is at the top of our diagram and is signified
by $A_0 \to B_0$:

<!--NOTE: three LaTeX (t-b) are Macro, Transition, Micro -->
$$ \Huge
{{{A_0 \atop \downarrow} \atop A_1}
{{\to \atop \ } \atop \to} 
{{B_0 \atop \uparrow} \atop B_1}}
$$

At the bottom there is also a causal relation $A_1 \to B_1$
occupying the `micro` level.
The micro is not given or immediate.
To access it may require deep thought, model building or the
use of instruments.

Moving between the two levels — micro and macro —
is characteristic of:

1. **Analysis**: determining the micro-level causes responsible for 
macro-level effects or outcomes
2. **Synthesis**: creating macro-level effects or outcomes through 
manipulation of micro-level components

The diagram above depicts an _analysis_ of the
`micro` causes of the `macro` event.

It is possible to restrict an investigation to
a single level, as shown in cases of

- **Micro-reduction**: "there is no society, only individuals"
- **Macro-reduction**: "our senses alone can guide healthy food choice" 

While the former is commonly referred to as "reductionism", in
contra-distinction to the "holism" of the latter, both are related as
being _kinds of reduction_, requiring a narrowing of perspective and a
denial of systematic relations.

## Epistemology, Ontology and Axiology

The "macro" does not necessarily refer to a **fixed, well-defined ontology**.
It depends on the context of an investigation.
The elevated position of the macro in a diagram
is also **not a value judgement**.
It is a focal point from which an investigation
can be initiated.

What delineates levels of analysis may be determined
by a specific domain of inquiry, with many levels lying either side
of the given `macro` level.

| Domain    | Micro     | Macro      | Mega            |
|---------- | --------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| Economics    | Individuals| Groups      | Societies         |
| Technology  | Components | Sub-assemblies | Devices  |
| Software  | Low-level code | High-level code | User interfaces  |

If there is an explanatory gap between two or more levels the ontological
concept of
"emergence" may be invoked.
Here, events occur and seem to be related but the mechanism that
relates them is not yet clear.
Importantly, this does not mean that the mechanism will never be
known.
It is likely that the mechanism simply remains to be discovered.

In summary, there is sometimes a question of the form "what $x_1$ is the cause of $x_0$?":

$$x_1? \to x_0$$

The $x_0$ could be a scientific observation, a desirable
state-of-affairs or a problem to fix at the
`macro` level.
Rather than presuming a mysterious _emergence_ we proceed in two ways:

In **analysis** the causes at the micro-level are identified.
For example, a specimen known to exhibit an effect of interest is scrutinised
with special instruments.
To explain why salt has an associated taste we might measure its
chemical dissociation in saliva, which enables the transmission of signals to the brain.
Salts may be observed to have different
intensities of saltiness, prompting measurement
of conductivity as the different salts dissolve into solution.

<!--NOTE: three LaTeX (t-b) are Macro, Transition, Micro -->
$$ \Huge 
{{Salt \atop \downarrow} \atop Na^+ }
{{\to \atop \ } \atop \to}
{{taste \atop \uparrow} \atop signal}
$$

In **synthesis** the effect (or outcome) is generated under specific conditions.
Inventing technology can help society make
progress.
Such progress is bolstered further when an
invention has a concrete implementation
as a product.
This facilitates exposure to the market,
which initiates mechanisms of feedback
that can improve the implementation.
Accelerating progress is not just about
getting products to market, it's also
about providing conditions in which
people can be inventive and supporting
feedback mechanisms to assist optimisation.

<!--NOTE: three LaTeX (t-b) are Macro, Transition, Micro -->
$$ \Huge 
{{Product \atop \uparrow} \atop Invent }
{{\to \atop \ } \atop \to}
{{Market \atop \downarrow} \atop Progress}
$$

The appearance of emergent properties may highlight an inappropriate conceptual or
methodological framing.
For example, water can be interpreted on a strictly molecular
basis as being composed of two kinds of elements existing in a certain relative
proportion and structured by particular forces.
This is the `micro` level.
Yet at the macro level water has properties like viscosity and
turbulence, which
are difficult to predict based on strict appeals to molecular
chemistry.
For this reason scientific fields like
rheology are oriented towards developing specific methodologies
appropriate to a relatively `macro` level.

## Kinds of Reduction

It is often mistakenly assumed that one level is superior or "more
foundational" as a form
of explanation.
A scientist may reject sense experience altogether as imprecise and
unreliable, despite its obvious utility and importance.
A "layperson" may reject scientific facts as counter to their
lived
experience despite their capacity to empower.

These different levels, however, exhibit a productive inter-dependence.
Science is often initiated after a surprise observation is made at
the `macro` level.
Subsequent discoveries at the `micro` level gradually become widely known, at
which point they become "common knowledge".

{% note(header="Feynman's artist friend") %} 
The famous anecdote from Feynman about his artist friend who appreciates the
beauty of a flower, but rejects its destruction by (micro)reductionist
biological sciences, encapsulates this tension.

Feynman does not deny that a flower is beautiful and that he can
experience that beauty.
He does not suggest that the scientific understanding displaces
this image.
Rather, the subjective experience of the flower can be enriched
by another level of understanding: the
micro, the scientific, the deep.

Scientists take this anecdote as demonstrating what
science can offer to the artist (method, understanding,
repeatability), while neglecting what the
artist can offer science (imagination, attention, creativity).
It works both ways.
{% end %}

Science is not confined to the `micro` level
and it is also not restricted to _analysis_
as an investigative mode.
The study of complex systems, such as biological and technological entities, often
involve sub-disciplines devoted to analysis and synthesis that may
overlap in large projects.

$$\Large
\overbrace{{{A_0 \atop \downarrow} \atop A_1}
{{\to \atop \ } \atop \to} 
{{B_0 \atop \uparrow} \atop B_1}}^{\text{analysis}} \iff
\overbrace{{{A_0 \atop \uparrow} \atop A_1}
{{\to \atop \ } \atop \to} {{B_0 \atop \downarrow} \atop B_1}}^{\text{synthesis}}
$$

## Food Example

With some varieties of green tea it is possible
to generate a bright pink colour if it is brewed
with baking soda and milk.
Recipes typically report that baking soda is needed
to generate the colour, without specifying _why_.

At the _micro_ level, baking soda is just an alkalising
agent.
It elevates pH resulting in chemical reactions
involving tea polyphenols that cause a
change in colour.

$$ \Huge 
{{NaHCO_3 \atop \downarrow} \atop OH^-}
{{\to \atop \ } \atop \to}
{{pink \atop \uparrow} \atop rxn}
$$

The original macro observation is still valid and may be
sufficient in many contexts.
Once we have a micro explanation we do not discard the
macro one.
Both levels can function together in an explanatory _system_.

## Benefits of Systemism

There are several advantages to developing explanations
across multiple levels.

### Abstraction

Someone may want to drink pink tea but is concerned about their sodium intake.
We have learned that the recipe does not require baking soda, however, only something
from the _general class_ of alkalising agents.

To increase pH we need something that releases $OH^-$ ions.
It is therefore possible to substitute baking soda for a sodium-free
alternative as long as it releases $OH^-$, like potassium hydroxide ($KOH$).

### Control

A significant market for pink tea has emerged and there is a demand
to manufacture it at industrial scale.
There is huge inter-batch variation in colour, however, and a need to better
control the process.

We have learned that a change in pH is critical for determining the
final colour of the tea.
Installing a pH measuring device to ensure that the correct pH is
consistently reached would seem prudent.

### Generalisability

Changes in colour induced by chemical reactions
involving polyphenols are unlikely to be restricted to tea alone.

Knowledge of the link between pH, polyphenols and colour does not
just help you understand the peculiar case of pink tea but
innumerable additional systems.
