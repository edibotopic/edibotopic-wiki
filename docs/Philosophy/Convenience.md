Convenience relates to the ease and comfort with which some process can be
undertaken.

It is typically assumed to be a positive quality.

An inconvenient process is said to have "friction".

Something that produces a negative result can involve a convenient process.

Friction can be associated with positive experiences, such as in game design.
