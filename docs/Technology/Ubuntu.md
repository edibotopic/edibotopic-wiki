## History

Ubuntu is a Linux distribution derived from Debian.

Debian is a volunteer project that develops a GNU/Linux operating
system.

Ubuntu is downstream of Debian and benefits from the thousands of packages
maintained by its community.

The most recognisable evidence of Ubuntu's connection to Debian is the `.deb`
package format, which is a Debian package or "Deb".

Ubuntu packages are frequently kept up-to-date with the upstream Debian
packages. In addition, Ubuntu package maintainers contribute improvements back
to Debian.
