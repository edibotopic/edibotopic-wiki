Windows is an operating system developed by Microsoft.

# Windows for Linux users

Windows is proprietary software.

Executable programs have the `.exe` extension.

The command prompt or `cmd.exe` is the equivalent to the Linux terminal.

A more recently-developed shell environment for Windows is [[powershell|PowerShell]].

To run commands with elevated privileges, you must open PowerShell in admin mode.

A version of `sudo` has been implemented for Windows, which offers an experience more similar to Linux.

As of Windows 11, there are certain features that must be enabled in Developer Settings.

It should be noted also that file extensions do not show by default in the Windows file explorer.

[[Sys admin|Sys admins]] can configure Windows systems through the Windows registry. This is somewhat equivalent to the [[dconf]] configuration system used by [[Gnome]].
